 <p><h3>1.Cedar-Plank Salmon</h3>
A big salmon fillet always feels like a festive main course, especially when it's cooked on a cedar grilling plank, so it picks up a whisper of smoky flavor. Kick off your seafood-themed dinner party with grilled oysters and pair the fish with a simple tomato salad.

<h3>2.Braised Chicken Legs With Grapes and Fennel</h3>

You'll want to have a loaf of bread on the side for sopping up the sauce.

                Entrees, also known as main courses, are the centerpiece of a meal. They are typically more substantial and complex than appetizers, designed to be the most filling and satisfying part of the dining experience. Entrees can vary widely depending on the cuisine and cultural traditions, but they often include a protein such as meat, fish, or plant-based alternatives, accompanied by vegetables, grains, or pasta.
                In Western cuisine, common entrees include dishes like roasted chicken, steak, grilled fish, or vegetarian lasagna. These dishes are often complemented by side dishes such as mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a fresh salad. In Indian cuisine, entrees might include rich and flavorful dishes like butter chicken, biryani, or paneer tikka, often served with rice or naan bread.
                The preparation of entrees can range from simple and quick to elaborate and time-consuming, depending on the ingredients and cooking methods used. They are designed to be the highlight of the meal, showcasing the chef's skills and the quality of the ingredients. Whether you're dining at a fine restaurant or enjoying a homemade meal, the entree is meant to leave a lasting impression and provide a satisfying culinary experience.
